# CODECRAFT-JIT
# Project Repository

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms and a web page project. Each task is briefly described below.

## 1. Reverse Stack

**Description:** This program implements a reverse stack algorithm using recursion. It takes a stack as input and outputs the same stack with the elements in reverse order.

**Key Features:**
- Uses a stack data structure.
- Demonstrates recursion for reversing elements.

## 2. Depth-First Search (DFS)

**Description:** This implementation of the Depth-First Search algorithm explores all vertices of a graph in depthward motion and uses a stack to remember the next vertex to visit.

**Key Features:**
- Works with both directed and undirected graphs.
- Can be used for various applications, including pathfinding and topological sorting.

## 3. Triplet Problem

**Description:** This algorithm finds all unique triplets in an array that sum up to a given target. It efficiently handles duplicates to ensure that only unique triplets are returned.

**Key Features:**
- Utilizes sorting and two-pointer technique.
- Returns a list of unique triplets.

## 4. Web Page Project

**Description:** A simple web page created using HTML and CSS that showcases a fictional company, WEBTECH SOLUTION. The page features a navigation bar, a hero section, services, testimonials, and a footer.

**Key Features:**
- Responsive design with a sticky navigation bar.
- Utilizes Font Awesome for icons and Google Fonts for typography.
- Attractive UI with hover effects.

## Getting Started

To view the web page, open `index.html` in your web browser. For the algorithm implementations, run the respective scripts in your preferred programming environment.
